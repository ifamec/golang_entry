# Chapter 10 Notes - Object Oriented

1. Golang supports OOP feature
2. Golang uses `struct` to realise OOP feature
3. Golang has no inherit (extends), overload, constructorï¼Œdestructor, hidden this pointer etc.
4. have inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism feature
5. Interface Oriented Programming

USE

1. extract feature of certain category of objects, to create a new custom data type ->  struct
2. create objects with the struct -> represents an object

```go
type structName struct {
field1 type
field2 type
}
```

## FIELD:

- field == attributes
- field could be basic data type or reference type

### !

1. field declare: `fieldName type`
2. type of field could be basic/array/reference type
3. will use default value if not assigned after declaration
    - reference type default is `nil`
4. different struct object is identical, will not affect each other
    - struct is **VALUE** Type
    - pass by value
      ![struct_copy](img/struct_copy.png)

## Declare

1. `var cat Cat`
2. `var cat Cat = Cat{"Oolong", 4, "Orange"}`
3. `var cat *Cat = new(Cat)`
     ```go
      var cat3 *Cat = new(Cat)
      (*cat3).name = "C3"
      cat3.age = 4 // Simplified
      (*cat3).color = "Ame"
      cat3.hobby = "Climb" // Simplified
      ```
4. `var cat *Cat = &Cat{}`

## allocate ram

- method 3, 4 will return struct pointer
- to assign and get value, use (*object).field
- could also use object.field // golang do transfer while compiling

![struct_pointer_ram](img/struct_pointer_ram.png)

!! `(*cat2.name)` // ERROR "." operator is higher than "*"

### Detail

- all fields in a struct is continuous in RAM
    - ![struct_pointer_ram_2](img/struct_pointer_ram_2.png)
- struct is a custom type, if need to convert to other type, **WIHCH REQUIRES EXACT SAME FIELDS (amount, name, type)**
- rename the struct, Golang will treat that as new type, but can force convert
    - [Check Code](struct06/main.go)
- each field could add a `tag`, and could get with reflect mechanism
    - serialization(to JSON) & deserialization
    - [Check Code](struct07_tag/main.go)
